>A NW.JS (Node-Webkit) yeoman generator for Node-Webkit, Express, Angular and Mean

Yeoman generator for NW.js (Node-Webkit). WEAN is coined name for Webkit Express Angular Node just like MEAN by  [Arvind Ravulavaru](https://github.com/arvindr21) .

## Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Yeaoman](http://yeoman.io/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)

## Installation
To install the generator:

`npm install -g generator-wean`

You need to have node, grunt, yo and bower installed globally before running the command. Therefore download node from the link and run:

`npm install -g yo grunt bower`

### Scaffold an application
Scaffolding a WEAN application works like every other Yeoman generator. If you have the generator installed, cd to an empty project directory and run:

`yo wean`

Interact with Yeoman to create the application.

## Running
The application will scaffold completely while generating but there are chances that npm and bower installation might not be successful, probably because of unstable internet connection as npm needs to download NW.js which is > 30mb therefore the application will not run.

If such case occurs, run `npm install` and `bower install` to complete the installation.

To run the NW application:

`grunt` or `grunt run`

## Building
Another amazing feature of this generator is that you can build to all mac, windows, and linux using a simple command. If you think you app is ready for consumption, run:

`grunt build:{platform}`

The platform placeholder can be win, mac, linux and all. Choose all to build for all the platforms. If the parameters are not specified, it builds for the current OS.

eg: 

`grunt build`

`grunt build:mac`

`grunt build:win`

`grunt build:linux`

`grunt build:all`


## How about Icons
Yeah. Icons. Icons are very easy to setup for mac and windows. Copy the `.icns` and `.ico` version of your icon named `app-icon` to the root of the project before building and that is all.

## Contributing
